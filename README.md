# Great Bare Island

##
⚠️ IMPORTANT: This mod is intended to be enabled prior to starting a new game.  If the mod is enabled and you load a game that wasn't started with it, you should be able to just quit the game, disable the mod and then reload the game and everything will go back to how it always was in that game.  I cannot gaurantee there will be no issues in a situation such as this, but have never had any problems in all my testing. ⚠️
